# MetaRAG

> A modular framework for building, benchmarking, and experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

MetaRAG is a student-built open-source project that separates a RAG system into interchangeable components—document loading, chunking, embeddings, retrieval, pipelines, and evaluation.

Instead of assuming a single retrieval strategy is best, MetaRAG makes it easy to compare multiple pipelines on the same corpus and inspect their behaviour.

---

## What can MetaRAG do?

✓ Build complete RAG pipelines

✓ Mix and match retrieval components

✓ Compare retrieval pipelines

✓ Benchmark retrieval quality

✓ Inspect intermediate retrieval results

✓ Save benchmark results for later analysis

## A Typical Workflow

```text
Documents
   │
   ├── Load
   ├── Chunk
   ├── Embed
   ├── Retrieve
   ├── Generate
   └── Benchmark
```

Benchmarking isn't a separate utility—it is part of the development workflow.

---

## Example

```python
from metarag import MetaRAG

rag = MetaRAG(
    docs="data",
    embeddings=...,
    generator=...
)

rag.fit()

answer = rag.ask(
    "What is the main topic of this document?"
)

print(answer.text)
```

---

## Project Status

MetaRAG is an actively developed student project.

The framework is intended for experimentation and learning. APIs may evolve before a stable `1.0` release.

Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are always welcome.
